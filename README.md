# EscapefromCultTown
Unity 2D project developed solo over a single weekend for a Halloween game jam. My user-submitted theme: Eldritch Monsters and Excessive Gore.

I posted periodic updates while developing:

In this game, you control three friends who have been abducted by Old God worshipping cultists. Help the friends escape
the cultist town before they sacrifice them!


Game Objective: 

                * Channel the power of the eldritch tome to stop the cultists and their rituals.
                
                * Don't die, and don't go mad.
                
Controls:

                * 1,2, and 3 to select one of the three characters
                
                * WASD or arrow keys to move selected characters.
                
                * Left mouse click to attack.
                
                * Right mouse click when near the tome to begin channeling it.
                
                * Right mouse click with a channeling character to stop channeling.
                
Other Information:

                * Red bars are health, blue bars are sanity. If either fall to zero, the associated enemy or character dies.
                
                * Channeling the eldritch tome drains your sanity over time.
                
                * When not channeling, sanity restores over time.
                
                * Channel progress will persist even if a character stops channeling to take a breather.
                
                * Channel progress is shared between all three characters.
                
                * The cultists will not stop coming until you channel the tome to stop their rituals.
                
Known Issues:

                * A lot.
                
                * Biggest, game-breaking one: If a character dies while channeling the tome, other characters are unable to 
                pick up the tome. Whoops. If this happens, press the page down key to reset the level.
